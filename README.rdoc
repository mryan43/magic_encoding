= Magic encoding

Magic Encoding is a little tool that allows you to quickly 
add or modify the magic comments that indicate source file 
encoding for an entire directory structure, please note that 
this tool only sets the comments, and does not perform any 
file encoding conversion whatsoever.

If you are looking for a way to convert files to a specific encoding, check out iconv (GNU)

I originally wrote this to get rid of "invalid multibyte char (US-ASCII)" 
errors when writing strings containing non ascii characters like éöàüèä
in ruby on rails controllers

== Installation

  gem install magic_encoding
  
== Usage

you can call the tool from the console with default parameters like so

  magic_encoding

this will prepend every ".rb" file in the working directory (recursively) with the following line :

  # -*- encoding : utf-8 -*-

Notes : 
- existing magic comments are replaced
- the rest of the file remains unchanged
  
you can pass options to the tool to specify the desired encoding and the path where you want the tool to run, for example :

  magic_encoding Shift-JIS /path/to/ruby/project
